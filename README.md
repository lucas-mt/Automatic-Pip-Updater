# automatic pip updater
### python script to automaticly update pip packages

\*obs.: due to some errors with the sdist kind packages, it's necessary for the user, if it wants to upgrade this kind of package, to pass as a parameter True in the command line.
for example:
> python3 -m uppip True

or, if it doesn't want to upgrade this kind of package
> python3 -m uppip
